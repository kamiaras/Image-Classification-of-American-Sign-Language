# Dataset
The dataset used for this project was created by [Akash Nagaraj](https://github.com/grassknoted). It is available on Kaggle as the [ASL Alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) Dataset.

## About the Dataset
The data set is a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.
- The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters *"A"* through *"Z"* and 3 classes for *"SPACE"*, *"DELETE"* and *"NOTHIN"*.
- The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.

# Model
We employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following [Torch-Summary](https://pypi.org/project/torch-summary/)-generated description:

The selected *Loss function* is *Cross-Entropy Loss*, which is a common solution for multiclass classification problems.
```python
loss_func = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```
The optimazer algorithm was chosen to be Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a starting learing rate
